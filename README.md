Hi, I’m Gabriel!

I'm a BSc in Management at PUC-Rio and Graduate Student in Economics at PPGE - UFPB. I’m interested in Economics, R, Python, SQL, Stata and Linux.

My research is currently focused on Labor Economics and Economics of Education.

I’m looking to collaborate on any of my interests above.

You can reach me by e-mail or twitter.
